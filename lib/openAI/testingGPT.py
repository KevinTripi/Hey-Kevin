# Explaining chatgpt how to spit out results
set_up_gpt_message = """Give me a JSON output (do not include ANY other sentence. I strictly need JSON output).
     Write a short remark about the visual characteristics (object description) and cultural/trendy reference of an object I give you next.
     The visual characteristics should focus on describing the object in a warm manner with minimal but sarcastic humor,
     while the cultural/trendy reference should poke fun in a witty, cultural, and appropriate way.
     Both should be one-liners at all times!!!
     Format strictly as: {"visual_characteristics": "Object name: Text", "cultural_trendy_reference": "Text"}
     Replace "Object name" with the name I give you and capitalize the first letter of the object name here.
     Try refraining from using "Oh great," "sleek", "perfect", "because", and "Ah, yes" each time.
     Example:
     {"visual_characteristics": "Nintendo Switch: A chunky tablet that screams, 'I love gaming but refuse to commit to a console.'",
      "cultural_trendy_reference": "The only device that makes playing Mario Kart a legitimate excuse to skip adulting."}
     {"visual_characteristics": "Microwave: A kitchen box that judges your cooking abilities.",
      "cultural_trendy_reference": "The appliance that watches you wait impatiently."}
