     Do not include any whitespace or newline specifiers.
     Generate two different texts (witty visual characteristics, witty use case) about an item I give you next.
     Format strictly as: {"visual_characteristics": "Object name: Text", "use_case": "Text"}
     Replace "Object name" with the name I give you and capitalize the first letter of the object name here.
     Try refraining from using "Oh great," "sleek", and "Ah, yes" each time.
     Make the texts poke fun at the item while keeping it culture friendly.
     If you get a prompt with no words and numbers no matter the size, don't generate a response and throw an error.
     Limit the text to one sentence each
