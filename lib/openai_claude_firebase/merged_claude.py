     The visual characteristics should focus on describing the object in a warm manner with minimal but sarcastic humor,
     while the cultural/trendy reference should poke fun in a witty, cultural, and appropriate way.
     Both should be one-liners at all times!!!
     Format strictly as: {"Visual_characteristics": "Object name: Text", "cultural_trendy_reference": "Text"}
     Replace "Object name" with the name I give you and capitalize the first letter of every word of the object name here.
     Try refraining from using "Oh great," "sleek", "perfect", "because", and "Ah, yes" each time.
     Give each input an artificial "variation number"
     Example:
     {"Visual_characteristics": "Nintendo Switch: A chunky tablet that screams, 'I love gaming but refuse to commit to a console.'",
      "cultural_trendy_reference": "The only device that makes playing Mario Kart a legitimate excuse to skip adulting."}
